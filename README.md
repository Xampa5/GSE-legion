# GSE: GnomeSequencer-Enhanced Legion 7.3.5
Based on [GSE_2.2.07](https://github.com/TimothyLuke/GSE-Advanced-Macro-Compiler/releases/tag/GSE_2.2.07) (3 April 2018), manually added the required librairie files. Shared here for you convenience.

**DO NOT** contact the original author about this outdated version, they have no wish to maintain it. Feel free to open an issue on this repo, I might be able to fix it.

Installation: Put the folders *GSE*, *GSE_GUI* & *GSE_LDB* inside *Interface\AddOns*.
